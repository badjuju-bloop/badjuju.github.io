            <h1>VALENTINE'S DAY MESSAGE FOR MY FATTY</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Happy Valentine's Day darling!!! Before we started LDR, we've always written each other cards during special occassions.  Now that we are so many miles apart, I wanted to try something different because just sending you a long text over Whatsapp is kinda lame. I've been learning a little bit of coding on my own and so I decided to give you a little surprise by building a website for you. It's not the most complex, but I tried to do it with what little knowledge I've learnt from coding online. Thank you for being mine for the past 3 years and for providing me with so much joy and happiness throughout. These past 3 years have been the happiest of my life because of you and I would not have wanted it any other way. You make me want to be a better version of myself daily and I often find myself trying to improve for you.</h3>
        <h3>I know there are some parts of yourself that you might not like about yourself like being emotional or worrying about your weight but all these small things about you are what made me fall in love with you. You have always and will always be perfect in my eyes and there's nothing about you that I would want to change. I love how your eyes light up when you get excited about something and I love your obsessions with jellycats and labubus. I love how excited you get when seeing an artist perform at a concert and your never-give-up attitude when you don't achieve something at first because you are so passionate about your goals and feel so strongly about things in this world. Your smiles are so contagious that I can't help but feel happy as well whenever you're happy, even through text.</h3>
        <h3>We've grown so much in our relationship together as well and my friends are always surprised to know that we've already been doing LDR for close to 2 years. From the time we first started going out on dates at the museum until now, I find myself falling more and more in love with you each day. I know that I won't always be able to cheer you up but I hope you know that I will always be here cheering you on and supporting you every step of the way. With you by my side, I've always felt that everything would turn out fine because I still have you at the end of the day and I hope I can make you feel the same way as well.</h3>
        <h3>I love you so much darling and I can't wait for us to reach new milestones together (moving in together, getting our first pet together). I hope these messages bring a smile to your face because you've been feeling a little down lately. DON'T GIVE UP OKAY DARLING I know you're gonna achieve great things one day and I can't wait to see what the future holds for the both of us.</h3>
        <h3>I miss you everyday and I can't wait to see you so soon in March ❤️</h3>
